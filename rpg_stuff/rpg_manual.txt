5)???

---game-mechanics----------------------------------------------------------------------

-party-stuff------------------

have up to a team of 4
-1 party leader (pL)
-3 party members (pM)
if pL is downed you lose.

pL cannot be hit if at least 2 pMs are up
-this can be changed with the variable:
-max_num_of_membs_alive_to_hit_pl_including_pl   #(i didnt know what to call it lolollo)
-its located in the test_rpg_battle_skill_list file

if pL doesnt exist, you lose if all pMs go down

pL also has a crit immunity and a refuse stat set to 1
-this can be changed in the class that defines pL's stats in the stats_and_vars file

the party formation is controlled by the rpg_config file

-enemy-stuff------------------

up to 4 enemys
if all enemys go down you win!
enemy formation is controlled in the battle_start function

-health-stuff------------------

4 included health types
1) hp / sp
- standard hp type
2) hp only
- similar to the hp/sp type but has no sp (obviously)
3) sp only
- cannot be hit or hit others. (ALL attacks will miss)
- slightly untested so may be buggy
- DO NOT SET AN ENEMY WITH THIS TYPE. THE BATTLE WILL BE UNWINABLE (ololo)
4) power (pwr)
- combines hp and sp
- dmg taken will subtract pwr and skills will also subtract pwr
- all skill costs will be multiplied by 5 (only for pwr users)
- pwr cannot go below 0

-downed------------------

if pM's hp goes below 0, they fall down.
cannot act if downed
on downed: lose 10 extra hp on top of what was received
will recover 5 hp per turn while downed

-stats------------------

6 main stats:
-attack
-magic
-defence
-sp_defence (magic defence)
-luck (used in crit calcs)
-speed (used in miss calcs)

-skills------------------

basically pokemon moves
cost sp
party and enemys both have skills
currently allows for pMs to have up to 5 skills

-equips------------------

3 types
-weapon (for attack ups)
-armor (for armor ups)
-charm (for other gimmicks)
character specific
equip stuff in the config file

((((unadded for spacemanman))))

-other-stuff------------------

miss----
determined by user's and target's speed
- favors target's speed
if an attack misses, 3 sp will be subtracted from the target
they cant dodge if they have below 3 sp
the miss cost can be changed with the variables:
- cost_miss (used if enemy dodges)
- cost_party_miss (used if party dodges)

crit----
determined by user's and target's luck
- favor's user's luck
with higher luck, the more dmg a crit will do
- also determined by user's/ enemy's luck
- still favor's user's
- min of x1.1 dmg

refuse----
allows user to live at one hp
added in stats

buffs----
they exist

resists----
they also exist

rage----
UNUSED (but can be re-added)
basically increases the dmg user deals

-unincluded------------------

level system
in battle items


---operation----------------------------------------------------------------------
to start a battle use the [battle_start(e1, e2, e3, e4)] function
the conditions are for each enemy, put in the id of the enemy you want to fight
see id list for all current ids
(use 0 for no enemy)

e1 = enemy 1
e2 = enemy 2
e3 = enemy 3
e4 = enemy 4 

example:
battle_start(104, 104, 104, 0)
^this will start a battle with 3 moldsmals

use the config file to change party

((((the party hp save system is not yet added for spacemanman))))


---adding-stuff----------------------------------------------------------------------

-add-character------------------

1)copy stats from StatTemplate in stats_and_vars file
create a new class like so:
---
global MyCharName   #<--[DONT FORGET THE GLOBAL]
class MyCharName(StatTemplate):
#add stats here (see StatTemplate for explanations)
---
2)then in party_conversion function located in the config_translator file
then add an elif like so:
---
elif member == var.MyCharName.id:
	return var.MyCharName
---

-add-skill------------------

similar to before:
1)create a new class based off SkillTemplate in the skill_list file
---
class Skill_MySkill(SkillTemplate):
#skillstatshere
---
2)then in party_skill function in the config_translator file
add an elif like so:
---
elif skill == lst.Skill_MySkill.id: 
        return lst.Skill_MySkill
---
3)add another elif under the skill_list function in the skills file
use this template:
---
elif stats.action == lst.Skill_MySkill.id:
	func.sp_sub_calc(stats, lst.Skill_MySkill.cost)      #subs skill cost
        stats.dmg = lst.basic_attack(stats, target_stats, lst.Skill_MySkill.)   #calcs the dmg, swap for needed dmg calc
        lst.miss_calc(stats, target_stats)           #calcs if miss
        func.health_sub_calc(stats, target_stats)    #subs the enemy hp
        target_stats.damaged += 1 * stats.miss       #adds the damaged state to enemy (used to check if was downed)
        func.sp_cost_miss(stats, target_stats)       #subs sp if was miss
        mes.battle_messages(stats, target_stats)     #displays message of action
        func.refuse_check(stats, target_stats)       #check if they can refuse
---
4)add a message in battle_messages (in messages_display file)
